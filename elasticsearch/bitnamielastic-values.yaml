security:
  ## @param security.enabled Enable X-Pack Security settings

  tls:
    ## @param security.tls.restEncryption Enable SSL/TLS encryption for Elasticsearch REST API.
    ##
    restEncryption: true
    ## @param security.tls.autoGenerated Create self-signed TLS certificates.
    ## NOTE: If autoGenerated certs are enabled and a new node type is enabled using helm upgrade, make sure you remove previously existing Elasticsearch TLS secrets.
    ## Otherwise, the new node certs won't match the existing certs.

## @section Master-elegible nodes parameters
master:
  ## @param master.masterOnly Deploy the Elasticsearch master-elegible nodes as master-only nodes. Recommended for high-demand deployments.
  ## If you are
  masterOnly: false
  ## @param master.replicaCount Number of master-elegible replicas to deploy
  ##
  replicaCount: 1
  
  ## Elasticsearch resource requests and limits
  ## ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/
  ## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  ## choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  ## resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  ## lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  ## @param master.resourcesPreset Set container resources according to one common preset (allowed values: none, nano, micro, small, medium, large, xlarge, 2xlarge). This is ignored if master.resources is set (master.resources is recommended for production).
  ## More information: https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15
  ##
  resourcesPreset: "large"

  ## @param master.heapSize Elasticsearch master-eligible node heap size.
  ## Note: The recommended heapSize is half of the container's memory.
  ## If omitted, it will be automatically set.
  ## Example:
  ##   heapSize: 128m
  ##
  heapSize: 1G
  persistence:
    size: 20Gi
